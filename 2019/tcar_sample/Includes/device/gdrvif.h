/*
 * Accept request
 *	Getes one request from the accepted requests queue.
 *	If there are no requests in the queue, it switches to wait mode
 *	until a request is received.
 *	In acpptn, the value obtained from DEVREQ_ACPPTN() is specified
 *	in OR in terms of the accepted request type (TDC_READ/TDC_WRITE)
 *	or the user command pattern. Although ordinary requests
 *	(TDC_READ/TDC_WRITE) have priority over user commands, an
 *	ordinary request and a user command may on occasion be accepted
 *	at the same time.
 *	tmout specifies the timeout interval in milliseconds. TMO_POL
 *	and TMO_FEVR may also be specified. The return value is either
 *	the request pattern or an error.
 *
 *	[Ordinary requests]
 *	The return value is the pattern that indicates the accepted
 *	request type.
 *	The accepted request is returned in *devreq.
 *
 *	[User commands]
 *	The return value is the pattern that indicates the user commands
 *	accepted.Where multiple types of user commands are waiting,
 *	all user commands specified in acpptn are accepted together,
 *	and returned in an OR pattern. NULL is returned in *devreq.
 *
 *	[Ordinary requests and user commands accepted at the same time]
 *	The return value is an OR pattern with both the accepted
 *	ordinary requests and the accepted user commands.
 *	The accepted ordinary requests are returned in *devreq.
 *
 *	[Timeout or error]
 *	The return value is the error code, or E_TMOUT in the event
 *	of a timeout.
 *	*devreq is undefined.
 *
 *	exinf of the accepted request (T_DEVREQ) cannot be changed.
 *	A buf area check (ChkSpace) has been implemented in the
 *	driver I/F.
 *	Reply to user command (GDI_Reply) is not required.
 *
 *	Normally, a request will not be accepted until processing
 *	of the previous request has been completed and the result
 *	returned. However, multiple requests may be accepted and
 *	processed simultaneously.
 *	Multiple requests may be processed either in parallel,
 *	whereby multiple request processing tasks each execute their
 *	own GDI_Accept(), or simultaneously, whereby a single processing
 *	task performs multiple repetitions of GDI_Accept().
 *	The order in which the results are returned does not need
 *	to be the same as the order in which the requests were accepted.
